# React Redux Examples

Special thanks to [HackersUTD](https://www.facebook.com/groups/utdhackers/) for hosting their React Workshop! This repo has the three versions of the tictactoe game discussed there.

- `tictactoe-original`: The [final result](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/gWWZgR?editors=0010) from the tutorial organized into separate files. See the complete tutorial [here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).
- `tictactoe-mui`: Similar to the original but using Call-Em-All's [material-ui library](http://www.material-ui.com/#/).
- `tictactoe-redux`: Uses the MUI library and the Redux design pattern.
